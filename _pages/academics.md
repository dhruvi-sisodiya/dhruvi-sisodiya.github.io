<!-- ### My story

💡 I have gained hands-on experience through internships at IOCL (Refinery Operations) and DRDO-IITGN (Fuel Cell Systems), where I worked on process optimization, simulation modeling, and technology demonstration. Alongside, I have developed strong proficiency in Python, SQL, MATLAB, and advanced analytical tools that enable me to approach problems with a structured, data-backed mindset.

📊 My interests lie at the confluence of business analytics, strategy consulting, and product development. I enjoy translating technical insights into actionable strategies, optimizing workflows, and identifying growth opportunities by aligning technology with real-world business challenges.

🌍 I aspire to work in roles that blend engineering knowledge with market insights, driving innovation in sustainable energy, emerging technologies, and product strategy. I am excited about collaborating with diverse teams to build impactful solutions that go beyond the lab and create tangible value. shorter just an intro

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
