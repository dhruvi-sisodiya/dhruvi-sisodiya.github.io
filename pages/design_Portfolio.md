ðŸŽ¨ I have a strong inclination toward graphic design and visual presentation, which Iâ€™ve actively nurtured through key leadership roles at IIT Gandhinagar. As the Design Team Lead for TEDxIITGandhinagar â€˜24, I spearheaded a 10-member team, shaping the eventâ€™s creative identity across merchandise, campaigns, and stage design. Similarly, as the Design Team Coordinator for Amalthea â€˜23, IITGNâ€™s annual technical summit, I directed a 25-member team to establish a cohesive brand presence, from social media outreach to large-scale campus and city-wide installations. These experiences not only deepened my creative and technical design skills but also honed my ability to lead teams, manage projects, and translate abstract ideas into compelling visual stories.
