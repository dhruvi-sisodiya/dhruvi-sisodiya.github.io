My name is Dhruvi Sisodiya, a Senior Undergraduate in Chemical Engineering at IIT Gandhinagar, from Vadodara, Gujarat.

### My story

üí° I have gained hands-on experience through internships at IOCL (Refinery Operations) and DRDO-IITGN (Fuel Cell Systems), where I worked on process optimization, simulation modeling, and technology demonstration. Alongside, I have developed strong proficiency in Python, SQL, MATLAB, and advanced analytical tools that enable me to approach problems with a structured, data-backed mindset.

üìä My interests lie at the confluence of business analytics, strategy consulting, and product development. I enjoy translating technical insights into actionable strategies, optimizing workflows, and identifying growth opportunities by aligning technology with real-world business challenges.

üåç I aspire to work in roles that blend engineering knowledge with market insights, driving innovation in sustainable energy, emerging technologies, and product strategy. I am excited about collaborating with diverse teams to build impactful solutions that go beyond the lab and create tangible value. shorter just an intro
